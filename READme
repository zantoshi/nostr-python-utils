Create a virtual env by running.
`python3 -m venv env`
Then activate the virtual env. 
`source env/bin/activate`
Once you have activated the virtual environment, run the following installs.
```
pip3 install -U pip
pip3 install -U setuptools
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
Now you are all set to use the python util library.

Check out the nip-01 and nip-23 for example usage. Happy hacking! 

I plan to add to this library over-time.
